; The original memory offset for the program we set with ORG was 0x7c00. Since we are no longer using it, 
; we now need to tell the program what memory offset to use to find our character by loading the offset amount 
; into a segment register (ds or es). So why do we set the offset register to 0x7c0 instead of 0x7c00? 
; Because the cpu multiplies the value of the offset register by 16, which moves the value up one place in hex.
; Thus, when we don't tell the assembler to assume an offset of 0x7c00 with the org command,
; we can't load bytes properly without an offset to tell the CPU where the value is actually stored.
; If we were to use the org command to tell the assembler where it will be loaded, the results would be flipped,
; since then the additional offset values would be added to the ORG offset, overshooting the actual locations.
